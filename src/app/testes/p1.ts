// q: what does it means Solid in prog ?
// a: SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).
//    These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
//    They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
//    The SOLID acronym was introduced by Michael Feathers.

// q: what does it means DRY in prog ?
// a: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a software development principle, the main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code.
//    In the context of SOLID, DRY is a principle that states that duplication in logic should be eliminated via abstraction;
//    every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.


// q: what does it means KISS in prog ?
// a: KISS, a backronym for "keep it simple, stupid", is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.
//    The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated;
//    therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
